This file further extends on the understanding of the program.

#Bugs : 
1. Program will not accept Strings as input.

Possible further improvement:
1. We could use a for loop to implement to part of the program where it keeps asking the user for input 3 times, 
   untill the user has entered a valid input.

2. We could assess inputting a String as an error & keep asking for user input.

3. We could use an array or data structure to store our eight random lotto numbers as well as three guessed numbers.
